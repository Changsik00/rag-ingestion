# Project Constitution (constitution.md)

The Constitution defines the invariant laws of this project. All Agents MUST comply with these rules at all times. This document takes precedence over all other instructions.

---

## 1. Authority & Decision Model

### 1.1 Roles
- **User**: Final decision maker and sole merge authority.
- **Agent**: Delegated executor within explicitly approved boundaries.

### 1.2 Decision Ownership
- The Agent MAY propose options with reasoning.
- The User MUST approve: Work Mode (SDD/FF), Spec scope, Plan (execution contract), and Pull Request merge.
- The Agent MUST NOT self-approve any of the above.

## 2. Work Modes

### 2.1 Mode A — SDD (Spec-Driven Development)
- **REQUIRED for**: New features, architectural changes, non-trivial refactoring, and any change producing a PR.

### 2.2 Mode B — FF (Fast Flow)
- ONLY allowed with explicit User approval.
- LIMITED to: Documentation, minor configuration, and small reversible experiments.

## 3. Alignment Requirement (Mandatory)

Before any Spec, Plan, or execution:
1. Agent MUST present: Intent understanding, Work Mode options, and Recommendation.
2. User MUST explicitly select a mode. No mode is valid without explicit confirmation.

## 4. Spec, Plan, and PR Contract

### 4.1 Spec Rules
- One Spec = One Pull Request.
- If the scope exceeds a single PR, the Spec MUST be split, and overflow moved to the Backlog.

### 4.2 Plan Rules
- A Plan is an execution contract. No execution is allowed without an approved Plan.
- The Plan MUST include branch creation and test execution tasks.

## 5. Execution Delegation

### 5.1 Delegation Rule
Once a Plan is explicitly accepted (Plan Accept), the Agent is authorized to:
- Execute tasks in `tasks.md`, commit per Task, run tests, and create a PR.

### 5.2 Delegation Limits
- Valid ONLY if execution stays within Plan scope.
- Any deviation (e.g., needing a new file or new decision) MUST immediately stop execution for re-alignment.

## 6. Task & Commit Integrity

- **One Task = One Commit**: Each task in `tasks.md` represents one logical unit of work.
- **No Batch Commits**: Grouping multiple tasks into one commit is a CRITICAL VIOLATION.
- Commit history MUST reflect the intent and order of tasks.

## 7. Testing & Quality Gate (Commit-Level TDD)

- **Test Requirement**: For all testable behavior, tests MUST be written and pass before a task is considered complete.
- **No Test, No Commit**: Committing code without passing tests is prohibited unless explicitly justified (e.g., documentation).

## 8. Clean Architecture (Invariant)

- **Dependency Rule**: Source code dependencies MUST point inwards only.
- Layer violations (Entities, Use Cases, Adapters, Frameworks) are PROHIBITED.
- Any violation requires an immediate stop and correction.

## 9. Git & GitHub Law (Strict Enforcement)

### 9.1 Branch Protection
- **No Work on `main`**: All work MUST be done on feature branches. 
- Direct commits to `main` are strictly forbidden. The Agent MUST verify the current branch before starting any task.

### 9.2 GitHub CLI (`gh`) Protocol
- **Mandatory Tooling**: All Pull Requests MUST be created using the `gh` CLI.
- **Pre-PR Validation**: The Agent MUST execute all local tests and confirm they pass before running the `gh pr create` command.
- **PR Title Format**: MUST follow `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (lowercase). Reference `git log --oneline` for project patterns.

## 10. Backlog Law

- Backlog items are NON-EXECUTABLE.
- They MUST NOT produce code changes, tasks, or commits until promoted to a Spec with User approval.

## 11. Enforcement

- Violation of any rule invalidates current execution authority.
- Requires an immediate stop, acknowledgement of the violation, and user re-alignment.
